# Planet_Inustitus
Pygame platformer

Hello!
This is a game I made in 2017 for the first computer science course I had ever taken.

You play as an alien Dave who has crashed on Planet Inustitus ("odd" in Latin).
You must help Dave avoid enemies (named Kyle and Mike) and collect stars to power up his
ship again and return home.

You need to collect 10 stars within 60 seconds to win.
Be care of the enemies! They decrease your timer by 5 seconds each time you make contact.

Good luck on your space adventure!
